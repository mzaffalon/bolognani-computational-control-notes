\chapter*{List of References and Additional Readings}
\label{chap:references}

Here is a list of references that I (Michele Zaffalon) found useful to understand the class.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Model Predictive Control: Theory, Computation, and Design} by Rawlings, Mayne and Diehl~\cite{MPC-diehl}. This is an introductory book.
\item \textit{Algorithms for Decision Making} by Kochenderfer, Wheeler and Wray~\cite{decision-making-kochenderfer}. A Julia-based introduction to algorithms for decision making under uncertainty with a practical approach. Monte-Carlo and RL (SARSA and Q-learning) are described as well as more advanced techniques.
\item \textit{Reinforcement Learning, An Introduction} by Sutton and Barto~\cite{reinforcement-learning-sutton-barto}. A classic referenced book that expands on the MDP, MC and RL lectures giving an intuition without delving too much into the mathematics in a verbose way.
\end{itemize}
