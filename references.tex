\chapter*{List of References and Additional Readings}
\label{chap:references}

Here is a list of references that I (Michele Zaffalon) found useful to understand the class.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Model Predictive Control: Theory, Computation, and Design} by J. B. Rawlings, D. Q Mayne and M. M. Diehl, available at \url{https://sites.engineering.ucsb.edu/~jbraw/mpc/}. This is an introductory book.
\item \textit{Algorithms for Decision Making} by M. J. Kochenderfer, T. A. Wheeler and K. H. Wray, MIT Press, available at \url{https://algorithmsbook.com/}. A Julia-based introduction to algorithms for decision making under uncertainty with a practical approach. Monte-Carlo and RL (SARSA and Q-learning) are described as well as more advanced techniques.
