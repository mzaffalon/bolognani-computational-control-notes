\chapter{List of References and Additional Readings}
\label{chap:references}

Here is a list of references that I found useful to understand the lectures:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Model Predictive Control: Theory, Computation, and Design} by Rawlings, Mayne and Diehl~\cite{MPC-diehl}. This is an introductory book.
\item \textit{Algorithms for Decision Making} by Kochenderfer, Wheeler and Wray~\cite{decision-making-kochenderfer}. A Julia-based introduction to algorithms for decision making under uncertainty with a practical approach. Monte-Carlo and RL (SARSA and Q-learning) are described as well as more advanced techniques.
\item \textit{Reinforcement Learning, An Introduction} by Sutton and Barto~\cite{reinforcement-learning-sutton-barto}. A classic reference book that expands the content of the lectures on MDP, MC and RL by giving an intuition without delving too much into the mathematics.
\end{itemize}
