# Personal notes for Bolognani's Computation Control ETH 227-0103-00L, Spring 2023

These are my personal notes for the course and reflect my current
understanding of the subject. The notes have *not* been reviewed by
the lecturer, Dr. Bolognani, so the usual warning applies: use these
notes at own risk!

Suggestions and PRs are welcome.
